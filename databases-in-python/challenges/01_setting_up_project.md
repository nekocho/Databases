# Setting up a project

_**This is a Makers Vine.** Vines are designed to gradually build up
sophisticated skills. They contain a mixture of text and video, and may contain
some challenge exercises without proposed solutions. [Read more about how to use

Learn to setup a Python project that connects to a database.

<!-- OMITTED -->

## Introduction

In this series of challenges you will build a few different projects. Before we
get started, you'll need to set up a new Pytest project.

This project will use a few components:

* **Python and Pytest**  
  The programming language and test framework will be the same as what you've
  previously used.

* **The `psycopg` library**  
  This library allows us to send SQL queries to the database, and retrieve the
  result set.

* **A class `DatabaseConnection`**  
  This class acts as a thin layer with methods to connect to PostgreSQL and send
  SQL queries to it.

## Set up your project

You will need to set up a few projects over the course of this module. You will
use a starter project to do so. It contains some helpful utilities to get you
going.

The first one is called `music_library`. [Set it up from the starter
here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/databases-in-python-project-starter)
