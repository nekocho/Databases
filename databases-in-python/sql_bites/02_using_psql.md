Learn to use the `psql` REPL to create a database and import data.

<!-- OMITTED -->

## Introduction

The database software (PostgreSQL) runs on our machine and manages the data we
need to store.

We interact with it using a language called **SQL**. It's a very different
language from JavaScript or Python. It comes with different commands to query,
create or modify data stored in the database.

On a high-level, SQL allows to us to run **queries** on the database and ask
things like:
  * Get all the records from a table.
  * Get all the records from a table where some conditions are met (e.g. where
    the name is "John").
  * Create a new record.
  * Update or delete a record where some conditions are met.
  * And more complex things, like create new tables.

Programs that talk to a database to create, read, update or delete data are
often called
[CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)
applications.

## Using `psql`

PostgreSQL comes with a built-in REPL, `psql`, that we can use to directly
type-in some SQL to interact with the database.

Run the command `psql -h 127.0.0.1` to enter the REPL - if you see an error,
look at the _Getting an error?_ section below:

```bash
$ psql -h 127.0.0.1

psql (15.2)
Type "help" for help.

leoht=# 
```

*The `-h` option specifies the IP address of the machine PostgreSQL runs on.
Here, we use `127.0.0.1`, since it's the local IP address of your own machine,
on which PostgreSQL runs.*

### Getting an error?

If you get an error similar to `connection to server at "127.0.0.1", port 5432
failed: FATAL: database "leoht" does not exist`  - you can use the `createdb`
command to create the default database `psql` tries to connect to, which is
named after your macOS system username.

For example, my macOS username is `leoht`, so I'd run the bash command:
`createdb leoht` - this should fix the connection error.

## Creating a database

Remember that a **database is a collection of related tables**. Usually you will
have one database (at least) for each project.

You will use the same database for these next SQL bites. Create it by running
the `CREATE DATABASE` SQL query.

```bash
$ psql -h 127.0.0.1

psql (15.2)
Type "help" for help.
```

```sql
CREATE DATABASE music_library;

-- You should get this output from the REPL
-- acknowledging the database has been created.
CREATE DATABASE
```

**Make sure you don't forget the semicolon at the end.** This is how we "end" an
SQL query (otherwise the REPL will keep waiting for the rest of the query,
without running anything).

You can now exit the REPL with `\q`.

_You can also create a new database from the terminal (without using `psql`)
with the following command:_

```bash
createdb music_library
```

_Here, we're using a PostgreSQL command which you'd pronounce "create db", where "db" is short for database._

## Importing the seed data

You've created a database, but it is empty for now, without any table(s).

In the following sections, you will work using seed data provided by us, with
tables that have already been created. All the needed SQL is in the file
[`music_library.sql`](resources/music_library.sql). You can clone
this module's repository to get the file on your machine, or download it
directly.

<details>
  <summary>What's a "seed"?</summary>

  ---
  **Seeds** are initial sets of data which can be used to populate a database
  and its tables, so that things aren't empty.

  Seeds are useful as they can give us some data we can begin working with,
  including writing tests which use that data which we can later use in TDD.

  ---
</details>

You can have a look at that `music_library.sql` file if you'd like. It contains
SQL queries to:
  * create the tables (the *structure*)
  * insert some records in these tables (the *data* itself)

Here's the general syntax to run SQL from a file using `psql`:
```bash
$ psql -h 127.0.0.1 {database_name} < {file_containing_sql}
```

## Exercise

Use the command described above to load the file `music_library.sql` on the
database `music_library`.

You should get the following output:

```
NOTICE:  table "albums" does not exist, skipping
DROP TABLE
CREATE SEQUENCE
CREATE TABLE
NOTICE:  table "artists" does not exist, skipping
DROP TABLE
CREATE SEQUENCE
CREATE TABLE
INSERT 0 12
INSERT 0 4
```

<details>
  <summary>Reveal the command to run</summary>

  ```bash
  $ psql -h 127.0.0.1 music_library < music_library.sql
  ```
</details>

## Demonstration

[Here's a video
demonstration.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wT1FVQbPZw&t=425s)

## Exercise

In the `psql` REPL, connect to the database `music_library`. You can run the
usual command to connect to the REPL, followed by the database name: 

```bash
$ psql -h 127.0.0.1 music_library
```

Then, once in the `psql` REPL, run the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM artists;
```

If everything worked, you should get the following result from the database.
This result is called a **result set** ‚Äî you will learn more about this in the
next bite. Well done on running your first SQL query!

```
 id |     name     | genre 
----+--------------+-------
  1 | Pixies       | Rock
  2 | ABBA         | Pop
  3 | Taylor Swift | Pop
  4 | Nina Simone  | Jazz
(4 rows)
```
