Learn to write `UPDATE` and `DELETE` SQL queries.

## Introduction

In this section you'll learn about two other type of SQL queries, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` which, as their name implies, are used to update and delete records.

## Updating records

The general syntax of the `UPDATE` query is:

```sql
UPDATE [table_name] SET [column_name] = [new_value];
```

And here's an example:

```sql
UPDATE albums SET title = 'A new title';
```

However this would update the `title` for **all records**, which is usually not what we want. 

### Updating specific records

We can also use the `WHERE` keyword to specify conditions, like for `SELECT` queries. Only records matching these conditions will be updated.

```sql
UPDATE [table_name] SET [column_name] = [new_value]
  WHERE [conditions];
```

## Deleting records

The `DELETE` query has a slightly different syntax, but works in a similar fashion.

Make sure you **always** specify conditions when using `DELETE` (unless you have good reasons not to), to avoid deleting the entire table.

```sql
DELETE FROM [table_name] WHERE [conditions];

-- Or, delete all records (never do this!)
DELETE FROM [table_name];
```

## Demonstration

[Here's a video demonstration.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wT1FVQbPZw&t=1710s) Make sure you attempt the exercise before watching the solution.

## Exercise

Update the `release_year` of the album with ID `3` to the value `1972`.

Use a `SELECT` query to get that specific record and verify it has been updated.

## Challenge

Delete the album with ID `12`.

Use a `SELECT` query to get the list of albums and verify that one has been deleted.
