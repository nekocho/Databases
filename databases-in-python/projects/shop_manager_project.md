# Shop Manager Project

We are going to write a small terminal program allowing the user to manage a
shop database containing some items and orders.

## User stories

Here's an example of the terminal output your program should generate (yours might be slightly different — that's totally OK):

```
Welcome to the shop management program!

What do you want to do?
  1 = list all shop items
  2 = create a new item
  3 = list all orders
  4 = create a new order

1 [enter]

Here's a list of all shop items:

 #1 Super Shark Vacuum Cleaner - Unit price: 99 - Quantity: 30
 #2 Makerspresso Coffee Machine - Unit price: 69 - Quantity: 15
 (...)
```
