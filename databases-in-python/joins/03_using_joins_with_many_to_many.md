# Using many-to-many relationships

Learn to select using a `JOIN` with many-to-many relationship between two
tables.

## Introduction

Let's consider the two following tables:

```sql
create table posts (
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	title text
);

create table tags (
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	name text 
);
```

A single post can be associated with many different tags (e.g. one post tagged
with `coding`, `python`), but a single tag could also be associated with
different posts (many posts could be tagged with `coding`).

A **many-to-many relationship** is needed when a record from the first table can
have _many_ records in the other table, and the other way is also true.

Such a relationship is made with a third table used to associate records between
the two tables. This third table is called a **join table**

## Importing the seed data

Import the seed data in the file `seeds/blog_posts_tags.sql` from the starter
into a new database. This will create three tables (`posts`, `tags`, and their
join table `posts_tags`) and insert some records.

Once this is done, use TablePlus or `psql` to work through the following
examples and exercises.

## Using a `JOIN` to select

```sql
-- Select all the tags associated with a given post.
-- Note how we're using two different joins to "link"
-- all the three tables together:
--    * first, by matching only records in the join table for the given post
--    * second, by matching only tags for these records in the join table
SELECT tags.id, tags.name
  FROM tags 
    JOIN posts_tags ON posts_tags.tag_id = tags.id
    JOIN posts ON posts_tags.post_id = posts.id
    WHERE posts.id = 2;
```

When writing a complex `JOIN` like above, it's often a good idea to diagram the
"path" of the different joins, from the initial condition (here, the post ID) to
the final result we need (the tags).

It's often helpful to read such a query in "reverse", starting from the end of
it:
  1. We filter records in `posts` by the post ID.
  2. We join the `posts` table with the `posts_tags` join table. 
  3. We join the `posts_tags` join table with the `tags` table.
  4. We get the tags.

## Linking two records

When dealing with a one-to-many relationship, linking two records together would
be done by using the right value for the foreign key on one of the tables.

When using a many-to-many relationship, however, we need to insert a new record
in the join table, using the two primary keys for the two records we need to
link together.

```sql

INSERT INTO posts (title) VALUES ('My amazing post');
-- New post inserted with id 3

INSERT INTO tags (name) VALUES ('poetry');
-- New tag inserted with id 5

INSERT INTO posts_tags (post_id, tag_id) VALUES (3, 5);
```

## Exercise One

Use a `SELECT` query with a `JOIN` to retrieve all the posts associated with the
tag `'travel'`.

You should get the following result set:

```
 id |          title          
----+-------------------------
  4 | My weekend in Edinburgh
  6 | A foodie week in Spain
```

## Challenge

Use SQL to insert a new tag `'sql'` and associate the post titled `'SQL basics'`
with this tag.

Then use a `SELECT` query with a `JOIN` to retrieve all posts associated with
the tag `'sql'` and verify the above worked.
