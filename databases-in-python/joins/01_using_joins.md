# Using joins to query related data

Learn to write `SELECT` SQL queries with a `JOIN` to query data from two tables.

## The N+1 Problem

So far you've been using `SELECT` to retrieve records from only one table. If we
want to select information both about an album _and_ its related artist, we need
two queries ‚Äî a first one to retrieve an album, and a second one to retrieve
information about the artist, using the foreign key.

```sql
-- First, retrieve the album
SELECT id, title, artist_id FROM albums WHERE title = 'Bossanova';

-- Then retrieve the artist using the foreign key value in artist_id queried above
SELECT id, name, genre FROM artists WHERE id = 1;
```

As our database grows and contains more data, this is not ideal. Every query
sent to the database adds some extra time to the query execution. If we were to
retrieve ten different albums, and then the associated artist for each of them,
that would mean running twenty SQL queries in total. This is a common issue when
working with databases, called the **n+1 problem**.

Thankfully, we can retrieve all this information in a single SQL query, using
what is called a **join**.

A join query "combines" rows from different tables in the same result set, based
on a relationship between those tables. Essentially we're running a single SQL
query, but getting results from more than one table.

Here is the general syntax:

```
SELECT [columns to select]
  FROM [table name]
  JOIN [other table name]
  ON [join condition]
```

Let's breakdown an example:

```sql
SELECT albums.id, albums.title, artists.id, artists.name
  FROM albums
    JOIN artists
    ON artists.id = albums.artist_id;
```

 * The first table we're querying on the left of the `JOIN` keyword is `albums`.
   We'll call this the "left" table.
 * The second table, on the right of the `JOIN` keyword, is `artists`. We'll
   call this one the "right" table.
 * We're specifying how the two tables are related, with `ON`. Since every value
   in the foreign key `albums.artist_id` references a primary key value of
   `artists.id`, we're using `artists.id = albums.artist_id`. The `JOIN` will
   match associated records by using this condition.
 * Note that we need to prefix column names (in the list of queried columns, and
   in the `ON` condition) with their table name, to remove ambiguity. If you
   forget to do this, you might end up running into this kind of error:
    ```
    ERROR:  column reference "id" is ambiguous
    ```

## The join result set

Let's run the following query:

```sql
SELECT albums.id,
      albums.title,
      artists.id,
      artists.name
  FROM albums
    JOIN artists
    ON artists.id = albums.artist_id;
```

```
 id |        title         | id |     name     
----+----------------------+----+--------------
  1 | Doolittle            |  1 | Pixies
  2 | Surfer Rosa          |  1 | Pixies
  3 | Waterloo             |  2 | ABBA
  4 | Super Trouper        |  2 | ABBA
  5 | Bossanova            |  1 | Pixies
  6 | Lover                |  3 | Taylor Swift
  7 | Folklore             |  3 | Taylor Swift
  8 | I Put a Spell on You |  4 | Nina Simone
  9 | Baltimore            |  4 | Nina Simone
 10 | Here Comes the Sun   |  4 | Nina Simone
 11 | Fodder on My Wings   |  4 | Nina Simone
 12 | Ring Ring            |  2 | ABBA
```

Even though we prefixed the column names, we still end up with two columns `id`
in the result set, although they reference different things. We can specify an
**alias** in the list of columns to retrieve to avoid this:

```sql
-- We added an alias for artists.id using the "AS" keyword.
SELECT albums.id,
       albums.title,
       artists.id AS artist_id,
       artists.name
  FROM albums
    JOIN artists
    ON artists.id = albums.artist_id;
```

```
 id |        title         | artist_id |     name     
----+----------------------+-----------+--------------
  1 | Doolittle            |         1 | Pixies
  2 | Surfer Rosa          |         1 | Pixies
  3 | Waterloo             |         2 | ABBA
  4 | Super Trouper        |         2 | ABBA
  5 | Bossanova            |         1 | Pixies
  6 | Lover                |         3 | Taylor Swift
  7 | Folklore             |         3 | Taylor Swift
  8 | I Put a Spell on You |         4 | Nina Simone
  9 | Baltimore            |         4 | Nina Simone
 10 | Here Comes the Sun   |         4 | Nina Simone
 11 | Fodder on My Wings   |         4 | Nina Simone
 12 | Ring Ring            |         2 | ABBA
```

You'll note that we have duplicate values for the artist name (the last column
of the result set). **This is expected**, as we have more than one album record
for each artist.

## Other examples

```sql
-- Find the album ID, artist ID, album title and artist name
-- of all the albums.

SELECT albums.id AS album_id,
       artists.id AS artist_id,
       albums.title,
       artists.name
  FROM artists
    JOIN albums
    ON albums.artist_id = artists.id;
```

We can also filter the result set by using `WHERE` ‚Äî specifying the filter
column.

```sql
-- Find the album ID, artist ID, album title and artist name
-- of all the albums
-- where the associated artist is ABBA.
--
-- (in other words, only albums by ABBA).
SELECT albums.id AS album_id,
       artists.id AS artist_id,
       albums.title,
       artists.name
  FROM artists
    JOIN albums
    ON albums.artist_id = artists.id
  WHERE artists.name = 'ABBA';
```

## Demonstration

[Here's a video demonstration.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DT7XuOqXsI)

## Exercise One

Use the database `music_library` for the following exercises. You can load the
seed file data in again with:

```shell
# From the starter project directory, in your terminal
; dropdb music_library
; createdb music_library
; psql -h 127.0.0.1 music_library < seeds/music_library.sql
```

Using `psql`, use a `JOIN` query to select the `id` and `title` of all the
albums from Taylor Swift.

You should get the following result set:

```
 id |  title   
----+----------
  6 | Lover
  7 | Folklore
```

## Exercise Two

Use a `JOIN` query to find the `id` and `title` of the (only) album from Pixies
released in 1988.

You should get the following result set:

```
 id |    title    
----+-------------
  2 | Surfer Rosa
```

## Challenge

Find the `album_id` and `title` of all albums from Nina Simone released after 1975.

You should get the following result set:

```
 album_id |       title        
----------+--------------------
        9 | Baltimore
       11 | Fodder on My Wings
```
